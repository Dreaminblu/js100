// In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check whether their return values differ and if so, how. 
// Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.

'8' == 8; // true
// == (standard equality operator) does type coercion

'8' === 8; // false
// === (strict equality operator) checks both value and type
